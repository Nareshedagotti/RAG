# Learn Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in a Week ‚Äî Basics to Advanced

Welcome to the ultimate guide to learning **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** ‚Äî from **theory to practical implementation**.

This 7-day curriculum is designed to take you step-by-step through the complete RAG pipeline. Whether you're an AI developer, ML engineer, data scientist, or just exploring how to build smarter LLM applications, this series is for you.

## 7-Day Learning Plan

| Day | Topic | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
|  1 | What is RAG & Why It Matters | Understand what RAG is, why it was introduced, and how it solves key LLM limitations |
|  2 | Data Ingestion & Knowledge Base Creation | Learn how to clean, chunk, and prepare your documents for retrieval |
|  3 | Embeddings ‚Äî Semantic Intelligence of RAG | Discover how text is transformed into vector space for similarity matching |
|  4 | Vector Databases & Indexing | Explore how embeddings are stored and indexed using vector search tools |
|  5 | Query Processing & Context Retrieval | Learn how queries are matched to data chunks and optimized for precision |
|  6 | The Generation Layer | Understand how LLMs use retrieved context to generate grounded answers |
|  7 | Evaluation, Metrics & Real-World Optimization | Learn how to measure performance, detect hallucinations, and deploy reliably |

> All topics include real-world use cases, mistakes to avoid, practical tips, and implementation code samples.
